RODRICK’S SCHOOL REPORT
Everyone know George Washington invented the (NUMBER)-dollar bill because it has his (PART OF THE BODY) on it, but I bet you don’t know anything else about the guy. He was born in (A PLACE). And when he was a kid, he chopped down his father’s favorite tree with a/an (NOUN). After that, he became a/an (OCCUPATION) and fought against the French in India. That’s why it was called the French and Indian (NOUN). When he was done (VERB ENDING IN ‘ING’), he married a/an (NOUN) named Martha (LAST NAME). I guess she loved him, even though he had teeth made of (PLURAL NOUN). They lived on a farm called Mount (LAST NAME) until George got tired of being a/an (OCCUPATION) and decided to help the United States win its (NOUN) from England. Everyone thought George was so (ADJECTIVE), they made him the country’s first OCCUPATION. When he died, George was buried inside a mountain called Mount Rushmore because it already had his (PART OF THE BODY) on it.
