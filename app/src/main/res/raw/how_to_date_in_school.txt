HOW TO DATE THE COOLEST GUY/GIRL IN SCHOOL
It’s simple: Turn the (PLURAL NOUN) and make him/her want (ADVERB) to date you. Make sure you’re always dressed to (VERB). Each and every day, wear a/an (ARTICLE OF CLOTHING) that you know shows off your (PART OF THE BODY) to (ADJECTIVE) advantage and makes your (NOUN) look like a million (PLURAL NOUN). Even if the two of you make meaningful (PART OF THE BODY) contact, don’t admit it. No hugs or (PLURAL NOUN). Just shake his/her (PART OF THE BODY) firmly. And remember, when he/she asks you out, even though a chill may run down your (NOUN) and you won’t be able to stop your (NOUN) from (VERB ENDING IN ‘ING’), just play it (ADJECTIVE). Take a long pause before answering in a very (ADJECTIVE) voice, “I’ll have to (VERB) it over”.
